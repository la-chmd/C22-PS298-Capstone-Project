Executive Summary
--
Providing a sense of safety, among other things, is of crucial importance to gain trust from the society to use public transportation. Many methods and attempts have been tried to improve it, yet many studies and reports still put the lack of sense of safety at the top of the list as to why people are still reluctant to use public transportation. On the other hand, rapid technological advancement, particularly in machine learning, has made it possible to create a system that can improve the sense of safety around public transportation, with relatively low cost and easy deployment. This begs the question: “how can we utilize machine learning in order to detect threats or crimes that happen in public transportation?” To answer this question, we are proposing a system that can detect crimes in public transportation. We are going to utilize TFLite and edge devices to capture and process images to detect crimes on public transportation, and then relaying the information to the public and the police via an Android app to increase awareness and improve the chance for a successful capture of the criminal.
